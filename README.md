# motivation
I usually download some video files using BaiduYun Cloud disk App in my cell phone. But the downloaded video files are in m3u8 format and can not be played directly with normal video players, such as MX Player App.
So I write some Python code to transform the downloaded video files into MP4 files. Then I can play the video in my cell phone.

I will share the Python code so that anyone who have the same problem can make use of it.
